Apr 14 17:11:28.000 [notice] Tor 0.4.5.7 opening new log file.
Apr 14 17:11:28.756 [notice] We compiled with OpenSSL 101010af: OpenSSL 1.1.1j  16 Feb 2021 and we are running with OpenSSL 1010109f: 1.1.1i. These two versions should be binary compatible.
Apr 14 17:11:28.757 [notice] Tor 0.4.5.7 running on Linux with Libevent 2.1.12-stable, OpenSSL 1.1.1i, Zlib 1.2.11, Liblzma 5.2.5, Libzstd 1.4.9 and Glibc 2.33 as libc.
Apr 14 17:11:28.757 [notice] Tor can't help you if you use it wrong! Learn how to be safe at https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning
Apr 14 17:11:28.757 [notice] Read configuration file "/home/user/NSSII/Exercise_4/Part2/VM2/./VM2".
Apr 14 17:11:28.758 [warn] Path for DataDirectory (./lib) is relative and will resolve to /home/user/NSSII/Exercise_4/Part2/VM2/./lib. Is this what you wanted?
Apr 14 17:11:28.758 [notice] Based on detected system memory, MaxMemInQueues is set to 737 MB. You can override this by setting MaxMemInQueues by hand.
Apr 14 17:11:28.758 [warn] You have used DirAuthority or AlternateDirAuthority to specify alternate directory authorities in your configuration. This is potentially dangerous: it can make you look different from all other Tor users, and hurt your anonymity. Even if you've specified the same authorities as Tor uses by default, the defaults could change in the future. Be sure you know what you're doing.
Apr 14 17:11:28.758 [warn] Unrecognized flag 'VM2_Auth' on DirAuthority line
Apr 14 17:11:28.758 [warn] TestingTorNetwork is set. This will make your node almost unusable in the public Tor network, and is therefore only advised if you are building a testing Tor network!
